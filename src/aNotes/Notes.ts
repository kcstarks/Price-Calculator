1. need to re-organize data.load_fee
    if we do someting like 
    mode: { 
        ambulatory: {
            load_fee: number;
            underfifty: cost/mile which is a number;
            underhundred: cost/mile which is a number;
            overhundred: cost/mile which is a number;
        },

        wheelchair: {
            load_fee: number;
            underfifty: cost/mile which is a number;
            underhundred: cost/mile which is a number;
            overhundred: cost/mile which is a number;
        },

        stretcher: {
            load_fee: number;
            underfifty: cost/mile which is a number;
            underhundred: cost/mile which is a number;
            overhundred: cost/mile which is a number;
        },
    }
